## Adapter Pattern

> Adaptor is a great way of connecting old code to new code. 

> So walking through the example,<br> 
  For an Employee Class having it's name,surname,id & email as the data points, <br> 
  if we come across an Employee Implementation using some different attributes, <br> 
  we could create a plug that converts the new Employee Implementation into an<br> 
  old implementation by an ADAPTOR.
